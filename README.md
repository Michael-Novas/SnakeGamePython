# SnakeGamePython

## Created a simple snake game using Tkinter in Python.  You're able to adjust some settings at the top of the code such as the game size, game speed, snake size, snake color, food color, and background color.
## The game itself is fairly simple, you use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control where the snake moves. Your goal is to collect the dots on the screen and have your snake keep growing without touching the edges of the screen.

## What I learned:
### - Tkinter Framework
### - Python
